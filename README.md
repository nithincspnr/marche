This is a coding assignment. It contains both backend Node.js and frontend (ReactJS) code.

## Quick Overview

Clone the repo. To start the Express js server,

```sh
cd express-app
npm install
npm start
```

The server will be running on port `5000`. You can verify it checking the URL `http://localhost:/5000` also test the one and only API route by going here - `http://localhost:5000/states?visitRange=0-250`.



To start the React App and see the frontend,

```sh
cd react-app
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be opened at `http://localhost:/3000` in browser once build completed.


_(The React app is created using CRA 0.1.0 and the Server with Expressjs 4.17.1)_
