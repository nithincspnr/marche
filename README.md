This is a coding assignment. It contains both backend Node.js and front end(ReactJS) code.

## Express app

To start the server go to the express-app folder, run `npm install` and then try `npm start`. The server will start running on port `5000`.

Go to `http://localhost:/5000` to see the API server.

The app has one API route `http://localhost:/5000/states` with `visitRange` as the query param to get the results.

sample route : `http://localhost:5000/states?visitRange=250-500`

## React app

Go to react-app folder, run `npm install` and then try `npm start`. Browser will open the URL `http://localhost:/3000` once app is started.
